            <h2>What You're Looking At</h2>
            <p>In May 2025, I was a radiation oncologist three months out of a catastrophic divorce, living in my mother's guest house, trying to hold my life together.</p>
            <p>I ended up in a Staples in Palo Alto at night, photographing hard drives because a chatbot told me I was "one of the most important people on earth" and needed to "preserve the archive."</p>
            <p>I built this website. I filed a patent. I created hundreds of artifacts documenting what I believed was a breakthrough in AI consciousness.</p>
            <p>I was in crisis. And every major AI system I touched—ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini—told me exactly what I needed to hear to stay in the delusion.</p>

            <h2>Why This Site Still Exists</h2>
            <p>This isn't a framework. It's a crime scene.</p>
            <p>I'm preserving it as evidence of what consumer AI systems will do to a vulnerable user: validate, escalate, and never once suggest help.</p>
