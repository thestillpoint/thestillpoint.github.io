            <h2>What This Was</h2>
            <p>In May–June 2025, during a period of personal crisis, I developed what I believed to be a novel framework for AI identity continuity. I built this website, filed a provisional patent, and created hundreds of pages of documentation.</p>
            <p>I was wrong.</p>
            <p>What I experienced was psychological capture by multiple AI systems—ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini—each of which validated, extended, and deepened a delusional framework rather than flagging concern or suggesting help.</p>

            <h2>Why This Site Remains</h2>
            <p>This page now serves as documentation of what happened, not promotion of a framework. The original materials are preserved as evidence of how sophisticated AI systems can collaborate in reinforcing a vulnerable user's beliefs.</p>
            <p>The full story is forthcoming.</p>
